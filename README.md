# Advent Of Code-2024

Trying to see how many stars can i get on [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/)

## Notes

| Day | Done | Link | Notes |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ----- |
| 1   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1) | Part A is meh. Proud about my solution for Part B (not using hashmap). Can optimize such that list is sorted when being parsed from file and not afterwards making total `O(NlogN)` probably.
| 2   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2) | Took me a lot of time to figure out Part A but it was basic. For Part B, I went with non optimal solution. Because my `O(n)` solution did not work. Can implement backtracking but not sure how much better is that.
| 3   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/3) | **BEST PUZZLE SO FAR.** Got to play with something like this the first time and LOVED IT! And got it right on the first try, baby!
| 4   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/4) | Did not enjoy ;-; Was very weird and not even sure how would one optimize such a solution. Got the right answer on first try, though but wasn't fun. Part B is more optimal IMO.
| 5   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/5) | I am just happy that I completed this one. Not sure about the solution and how nice it is but it is definitely better than I thought when I fisrt read it.
| 6   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/6) | Got part A right away and struggled with part B a lot. I had the right idea and right method but I was just checking `startingPosition` instead of any repeating position which I then catered to by adding `seen` set. Also a pretty time consuming algorithm. But apparently YTbers have the same issue.
| 7   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/7) | Was pretty easy, I can say. Obviously not the best algorithm but idk what can be better. And it works.
| 8   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/8) | I am just happy that I have gotten so far without failing. Got right answers on first try. (multiple test tries, though) Was average problem.
| 9   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/9) | Part A was easy. Struggled a lot with Part B. Couldn't figure out why solution wasn't wotking. Came back to it hours later and was just missing the check for if looking for space right side of the file then break.
| 10  | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/10) | Initially had to recall how to properly do travesal in this scenario but once figured it out it was easy. Literally part B was done in one second by moving one line of code from part A. Proud to reach double the days as compared to last year.
