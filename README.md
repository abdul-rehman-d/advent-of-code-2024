# Advent Of Code-2024

Trying to see how many stars can i get on [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/)

## Notes

| Day | Done | Link | Notes |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ----- |
| 1   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1) | Part A is meh. Proud about my solution for Part B (not using hashmap). Can optimize such that list is sorted when being parsed from file and not afterwards making total `O(NlogN)` probably.
| 2   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2) | Took me a lot of time to figure out Part A but it was basic. For Part B, I went with non optimal solution. Because my `O(n)` solution did not work. Can implement backtracking but not sure how much better is that.
| 3   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/3) | **BEST PUZZLE SO FAR.** Got to play with something like this the first time and LOVED IT! And got it right on the first try, baby!
| 4   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/4) | Did not enjoy ;-; Was very weird and not even sure how would one optimize such a solution. Got the right answer on first try, though but wasn't fun. Part B is more optimal IMO.
| 5   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/5) | I am just happy that I completed this one. Not sure about the solution and how nice it is but it is definitely better than I thought when I fisrt read it.
