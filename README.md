# Advent Of Code-2024

Trying to see how many stars can i get on [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/)

## Notes

| Day | Done | Link | Notes |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ----- |
| 1   | [X]  | [goto](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1) | Part A is meh. Proud about my solution for Part B (not using hashmap). Can optimize such that list is sorted when being parsed from file and not afterwards making total `O(NlogN)` probably.
